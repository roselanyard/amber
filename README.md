# Amber: a software tool to provide access to a visual field via timbres

A novel vision assistance technology using timbres to describe a field of vision.

Amber converts stereographic video into a tone whose timbre contains information about phenomena in the world (currently the depth of objects in the visual field from the observer.) We hope that this technology could be used to develop a wearable hardware device which provides access to a visual field to people with visual impairments.
